In the Row widget, the children widgets are arranged horizontally on the screen. 

For example,

```dart
Row(children: [
        Text(
          'Text1',
        ),
        Text(
          'Text2',
        ),
        Text(
          'Text3',
        ),
      ],
    )
```

 **`Text`**  widgets will be displayed horizontally from left to right, as shown in the picture below:

In a row widget, you can choose how its children are aligned based on the **`crossAxisAlignment`** and **`mainAxisAlignment`** properties. The row's cross-axis runs vertically, while the main axis runs horizontally. Below is a visual representation that makes it clearer:

<!-- A screenshot of how the alignments properties will work in Row widget -->

```dart
SafeArea(
  child: Column(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start, 
    children: [
      Row(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          Image.asset(
            'assets/images/profile.png',
            width: 200,
            height: 200,
          ),
        ],
      ),
      Row(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
        children: [
          Text(
            'Name: Cat Show',
          ),
          Text(
            'Name: Cat Show',
          ),
          Text(
            'Name: Cat Show',
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ],
  ),
  )
```

<!-- A screenshot of how does the final result look like -->

 **`MainAxisAlignment.center`** will place the children widgets in the middle of the main axis. And **`MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround`** will place the free space between the children widgets evenly and what equals half of that space before the first widget and after the last one.
