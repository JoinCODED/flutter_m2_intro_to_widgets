Whenever you press a button, a certain action will occur. In the previous section, you added the weird value `(){}` to `onPressed`. But what is it exactly?

So far, you have seen that `child` is expecting some kind of widget. That widget could be `Text`, `Button`, `Column`, `Row` and so on… However, **`onPressed`** expects an action when pressing the button. You can't pass widgets, you have to pass commands. To better understand, let's assume that you are writing in two different languages:

1. Flutter widget language.
2. Dart logic language.

Flutter widget language is responsible for everything shown on the screen: what it looks like, the color of the button, the size of the font, and so on… Dart language can do commands, stores values, and adds some dynamics to the applications. 
When we press a button, we want to do some sort of action. If you want to calculate your grade for example, you need to do some calculations and add numbers together. You do that with Dart.

You are going to learn more about Dart language in the upcoming lessons.
