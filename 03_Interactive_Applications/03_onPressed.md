# **onPressed**



When pressing a button, a certain action will happen. This action will only happen if you press the button. If you press the button twice, the action will excute twice on each click. We added the weirdo value `(){}` to on Pressed. but what is that exactly? 



So far, we've seen that child is expecting some kind of a widget. That widget could be Text, Button, Column, Row and so on… But **onPressed** is something that expects an action that will happen after pressing the button. We can't pass widgets. We have to pass commands. To understand that easier. Let's assume that we're writing now in 2 different languages. 

	1. Flutter widget language 
	1. Dart logic language 



Flutter widget language is going to be responsible for everything that's going to be shown on the screen. How they look like, what color is the button, how large is the font, and so on… Dart language can do commands, store values, and add some dynamics to the applications. For example, when pressing a button, we want to do some sort of actions. If you want to calculate your grade for example, you need to do some calculations and add numbers together. We do that with Dart. We're going to learn Dart language more in the upcoming lessons.
